VS2015 Dark Theme for Notepad++ and Atom
=============

This is as close as I can get to a replica of the Visual Studio 2015's Dark theme in Notepad++ and Atom. I created it to ease switching between files opened in Visual Studio and Notepad++. Particularly close attention has been paid to C, C++, and XML but a number of other languages have been tested.

Installation - Notepad++
--------------------------

1. Download [`VS2015-Dark.xml`](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Nidre/Npp-VS2015-Dark/master/VS2015-Dark.xml), making sure to get the raw version, to `%PROGRAMFILES%\Notepad++\themes` (`%PROGRAMFILES(X86)%\Notepad++\themes` on 64-bit systems).
2. Restart Notepad++.
3. Open *Settings->Style Configurator*.
4. Select `VS2015-Dark` from the theme drop-down box.
5. Click *Save & Close*

Installation - Atom
--------------------------
